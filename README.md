# Daily-Planner


## Description
This Code Quiz Project was created as part of the Bootcamp course with EDx. This Page runs in the browser and contains a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day, dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The Calander Applciation displays the current day at the top of the calendar and Presents timeblocks for standard business hours.The user can enter a task when they click a timeblock with a colour scheme that notes if the timeblock is in the past, present, and future. Whent the save button is clicked on teh target timeblock, the event is saved to local storage, where the event persists between refreshes of a page.
